    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>I provided alternative text to images to help the visually impaired. I also centered the image to make it more visible.</p>
      
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>I put links to external sites and a link to a .pdf file. I also have links to .mp3 and .mp4 files for music and video respectively.</p>

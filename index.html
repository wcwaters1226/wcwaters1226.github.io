      <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a freshman at FGCU majoring in software engineering. My oldest brother who is currently a software engineer
      at Blue Origin is who inspired me to pursue a degree in software engineering. My senior year of high school I volunteered
      at my local hospital in the IT Department and I learned the basics of computers and IT. I still feel like I am completely new
      to the field with Intro to Computer Science being the first class I am currently taking that is related to Software Engineering.
      However, I am excited to be finally learning more. </p>
    
    <p>Outside of computers, my other other interests include basketball, working out, and movies.

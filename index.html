      <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>I am a freshman at FGCU majoring in software engineering. My oldest brother who is currently a software engineer
      at Blue Origin is who inspired me to pursue a degree in software engineering. I started trying to learn programming in high school
      through tutorials on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_542436899010830553783728/">Khan Academy</a>, but didn't
      quite get the hang of it. My senior year of high school I volunteered at my local hospital in the IT Department and I learned the
      basics of computers and IT. I still feel like I am completely new to the field with Intro to Computer Science being the first class
      I am currently taking that is related to Software Engineering. However, I am excited to be finally learning more. </p>
    
    <p>Outside of computers, my other other interests include basketball, working out, and movies. I played basketball all 4 years of 
    high school and I have continued playing through intramurals here at FGCU. I also enjoy working out as it helps me relieve my stress 
    and with me being an engineering student, stress doesn't come in a short supply so you will likely find me in the gym often.
    Whenever I am not playing basketball or working out I'm usually in my room watching movies. I am moderately obsessed with movies
    as I've seen over 1,000 (yes I keep track) and enjoy writing mini reviews for a majority of the movies I watch where you can 
      read <a href="https://letterboxd.com/willwaters/films/reviews/"> here.</a> Also, here is a list of my top 5 movies: 
      <ol><font size="5px">
        <li>Raging Bull</li>
        <li>Pulp Fiction</li>
        <li>Saving Private Ryan</li>
        <li>Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind</li>
        <li>Boogie Nights</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>I also like creating music on my free time through FL Studio. Here's a snippet of one of the rap beats I've made.</p>

      <p>Filmmaking is another one of my hobbies. Here is a project I created for a film class my senior year of high school.<p/>
